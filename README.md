# ESP32-Sensor-Dashboard-with-TFT-Display-and-NTP-Time-Sync
This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to create a multi-functional sensor dashboard.


Project Description:
This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to create a multi-functional sensor dashboard featuring:
Temperature monitoring with a DS18B20 sensor.
3-axis acceleration measurement using the ADXL345 accelerometer.
Real-time clock synchronization via NTP (Network Time Protocol).
User interface with a TFT display that cycles through temperature, acceleration data, and current time using a push button.
WiFi connectivity to obtain accurate time from an NTP server, with WiFi disabled afterward to save power.
The code demonstrates integration of multiple sensors, real-time timekeeping, and an interactive display interface suitable for embedded systems and IoT applications.
